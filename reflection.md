In this lab, the procedure was greatly reduced, and we were tasked with only working on the coding portion of this project.
The objective of this project was to create an ASCII art generating tool that would output a circle, a given number of lines, or one of three random designs.
First, I wrote out the functions for the single circle and the input lines, which were simple enough as they were.
Then, I tasked myself with creating the three ASCII arts from scratch using complex line formatting.
On that topic, such functions were the main lesson to be taught in this project. Essentially the objective was to figure out what they were and what they could be used for.
My first code iteration managed to output what I expected, so I was pleased with that result.
This project did not implement test cases.
The main problem I came across during this project was just coming up with the unique ASCII design, which to my admission dont actually look very good or interesting.
Then again, I'd argue that a lot of ASCII art, unless its a coding marvel, like the spinning donut, aren't really in general.
Some key takeaways I had from this project were not to be afraid of advanced string formating (it's not that complicated) and to let down all barriers when trying to creative.
I think I ultimately learned what I was supposed to in this lab, as a result. Working as an individual in this project wasn't particularly gamechanging due to the small workload.
As such, I don't have many comments to make of it other than that I enjoyed the autonomy I had in this project.
